# reactjs-demo
A demo of ReactJS with JSX

This is a demo to go with my ReactJS on the OPI website.

To start:

   > npm install

to install the webserver (or put it on your own)

and then 
   > npm start

to look at it.

The US States in JSON format was fetched from there:

Disclaimer: This demo is supposed to be show how to use ReactJS with a large JSON object. The claim "Well you should be getting that with AJAX" or some other way that this is wrong is probably accurate... but sometimes the real world doesn't do things the right way. I'm just illustrating the situation I was in and how ReactJS came to my rescue.
